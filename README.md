# NewSense

New Sense Active is a work in progress e-commerce prototype aiming to unite abstract art and business analytics. 

This is a currently a passion project developed by [Nicholas Lopez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/310-nicholas-lopez/)

All resources for learning are in the Todo.md file, where by very low standards I also kept a journal.

My goal with New Sense is two fold, first it is an attempt to bring the user closer to the future, by showcasing to the best of my ability a meshing of Sci-fi UI concepts and abstract data handling. Second, this project for me is also a learning experience and a cathartic execise to express my technical ability. 

If you are interested in chatting, please contact me through linkedIn or some other form of communication.

I am available for hire and am looking work with others! :) 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed with Google Firebase Cloud Solutions. Stripe's Payment Processing API was also integrated and plans for future third party integrations are in the works.
