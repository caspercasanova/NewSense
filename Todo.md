## 6/19/2020: First Log In A Long Time. 
      -Made lots of leaps and am begining to find/discover a design aesthetic. House Music and Half-Life are the main influences on NSA design approach as of currently. Things that have been created are as follows:
            -Tray component that hold children and has animated hover edges. Fairly dynamic but am not completely satified
            -Animted Text Component that utilizes React-Spring to make a typewriter effect. Pretty Neat and more research into React-Spring is necessary
            -A useInterval hook that is extremely useful for clean intervals in react. Happy I found it. 
            -Stripes API, though deep and unique, is beginning to resonate with my capacity to utilize it. My mental model differs from Stripes API and perhaps paypal would be different but Stripes Docs is simply incredible and its actually a joy using it.
            -Components that I have always wondered how to create are now for me easy to create like landing pages and stock tickers and carousels. 
            -Sci-Fi design is cool and almost a study of its own. 
            -Components like a Coming Soon Modal extremely important and more things like them need to be discovered and iterated upon. 
            

            



## 6/19/2020: Things To Ponder
      - (Business Model/Product Is Insufficient)
        - Selling a digital product seems to fall more in line with stripes API as they really promote Developers to utilize the subscription model. I don't know of a product that could utilize such a method, yet....
      - Designing Components Raw Components For Re-Use Is Not A Waste Of Time
      - Efficiency of design is really important and a stylesheet can very easily become out of control fairly quickly. A system will need to be discovered. SASS is awesome, but may not be the best
      - Another component similiar to a Tray needs to be found. A Container/Tray of some sort

## 6/19/2020: Formatting Code and Searching For Utility In Code 
      -Formating File Structure. Might Create a Services folder that includes a Format, ErrorTracking and Currency Formatting. https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure suggest creating a domain formating for react files which i might agree with



## 6/30/2020: Stripe integration is pretty much done integrated. Things i needede to do include : 
      - A shopping cart component that posts to the server everytime the shopping cart updates
      -
